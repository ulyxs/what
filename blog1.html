                <h1 id="blogTextchap3">III. <span id="blogTextcapsule">ANALYSIS</span></h1>
                <p id="blogTextpara10">My father was an electronics engineer who built circuits and assembled computers when I was young. Between the ages of six and seven, I would spend hours on the computer exploring different software, making shapes in Paint, or playing The Sims 2. Those early experiences sparked my curiosity about how systems work, how the software I played with was created, and how the computer itself enabled those programs to run. That curiosity eventually led me to look back at the history of computing, and it’s astonishing how far technology has come. Although computing began as a tool for mathematical calculations, it was once described as performing more calculations than all of humanity combined (Computer History Museum, n.d.); its impact has grown beyond what it was originally intended for.</p>
                <p id="blogTextpara11">While the purpose of computers has remained consistent, automating tasks and solving problems efficiently (Lindenwood University, n.d.), the way we use them has transformed dramatically. What once required machines the size of rooms and kilometers of wiring can now be done instantly on devices that fit in our hands. Today, connectivity is just a tap away through our smartphones. Without computers, where would humanity be? They have propelled civilization forward and reshaped how we live, learn, and understand the world around us.</p>
                <p id="blogTextpara12">More importantly, computing has given rise to diverse disciplines and fields, each offering unique ways to explore, create, and innovate. Every discipline plays an important role in expanding the boundaries of computing. Although problems are approached step-by-step, the way these disciplines offer is how to uniquely solve problems in their own way, or what interaction can efficiently and effectively solve that problem. None should be underestimated, because together they share the same goal, which is to advance technology for the betterment of humanity.</p>
                <p id="blogTextpara13">For all the progress achieved, I like to think of computing as a seed that has grown into a flower, blossoming into countless disciplines and fields. Many people wish they had been born in another generation, but I am grateful to live in the computing age, where information is accessible at our fingertips and opportunities to learn are greater than ever.</p>
